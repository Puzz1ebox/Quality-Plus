  "description": "This mod was designed to expand the existing quality system. \nIt currently adds 4 different qualities to the game: Mythical, Masterwork, Wonderous, and Artifactual. \nThe goal of this mod is to offer more options for late-game resource sinks without divesting far from the original Factorio intent or art style. \nLooking for testers to determine if this is balanced.
